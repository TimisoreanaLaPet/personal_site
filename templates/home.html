        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            I’m a recent Computer Science graduate who loves building full-stack
            applications that are both useful and easy to use.
            My main stack is Java + Spring Boot on the backend and
            TypeScript + React on the frontend.
            I enjoy collaborating with others, learning new tech quickly,
            and turning ideas into working software.
            Right now, I’m excited to start my career as a software developer
            and grow by contributing to real-world projects.
